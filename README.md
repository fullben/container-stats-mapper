# Docker Stats Mapper

Tiny (and by no means complete) project for mapping the rather complex JSON objects returned by the stats API of a Docker host.

This application can be used to map or reduce the JSON files containing such objects to another custom JSON object. For this, simply supply the directory path in the `main` method of the `Main` class and execute it using the IDE of your choice.
